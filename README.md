## 1. Data Analysis with Pandas

**Project Description:**  
This project demonstrates basic data analysis techniques using the Pandas library in Python. The task involved loading a CSV file and performing basic operations such as finding the average of a column, summarizing data, and analyzing key insights.

**Features:**
- Loading and analyzing CSV files.
- Calculating basic statistics like mean, sum, and count.
- Handling missing data and cleaning datasets.

**Installation:**
pip install pandas

**How to Run:**

Clone the repository.
Navigate to the project directory.
Ensure the dataset (CSV file) is in the same directory.
Run the Python script:
bash
python data_analysis_pandas.py

## 2. Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
**Project Description:**
In this project, I explored various visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The dataset was visualized using bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to better understand trends, correlations, and patterns.

**Features:**

Bar chart: Average energy consumption by vehicle models.
Scatter plot: Battery capacity vs. energy consumption.
Heatmap: Correlation matrix between numerical features.
Distribution plots for charging cost and duration.

**Installation:**
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas

**How to Run:**

Clone the repository.
Ensure the dataset is available.
Execute the script:

## 3. Command-Line E-Mail Sender
**Project Description:**
This project showcases a command-line tool that sends emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). It supports sending plain-text emails with or without attachments via the terminal.

**Features:**

Send emails directly from the command line.
Support for multiple recipients.
Support for attachments (optional).

**Installation:**

pip install smtplib email

**How to Run:**

Clone the repository.
Modify the Python script with your SMTP credentials and recipient details.
Run the script:
python email_sender.py <br>

**Usage Notes:**
Ensure your SMTP credentials (e.g., Gmail) are set up properly. Use App Passwords if using Gmail and two-step verification.

## 4. Command-Line Chatbot
**Project Description:**
This is a simple command-line chatbot that interacts with users via text input. The chatbot uses basic conditional logic to handle conversations, answer predefined questions, and perform simple tasks like setting reminders.

**Features:**

Rule-based chatbot using conditional statements.
Handles simple conversation flows.
Supports customization for additional responses.
**Installation:**
No additional libraries are required for this basic chatbot.

**How to Run:**

Clone the repository.
Run the chatbot script:
bash
python chatbot.py <br>
**Example Conversation:**

Chatbot: Hello! How can I assist you today? <br>
You: How are you? <br>
Chatbot: I'm doing well, thank you! How can I help you? <br>
You: Bye <br>
Chatbot: Goodbye! <br>
